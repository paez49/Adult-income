# Adult income
Machining learning algorithms performed on an adult income dataset. It shows individual’s annual income results from various factors. Thar are influenced by some factores like individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

Data extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset).

## Datset fields specification
- The dataset contains 16 columns
- The income is divide into two classes: <=50K and >50K
- Number of attributes: 14

## General objective
The general objective of this project is to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year or not.

### Specific objectives
- Predict the income level based on the individual’s characteristics.
- Use machine learning algorithms to predict the income level.
- Compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

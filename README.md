# Adult income

An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

This is a widely cited KNN dataset. I encountered it during my course, and I wish to share it here because it is a good starter example for data pre-processing and machine learning practices.

Data extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset).

## Fields
The dataset contains 16 columns
Target filed: Income 

The income is divide into two classes: <=50K and >50K

Number of attributes: 14

These are the demographics and other features to describe a person

We can explore the possibility in predicting income level based on the individual’s personal information.


## General objective

The general objective of this project is to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year or not.
